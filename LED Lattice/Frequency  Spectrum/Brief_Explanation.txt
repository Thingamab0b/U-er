The last part of LED Lattice!
Main Peripheral device: MAX4466 (Microphone collecting the sound)
Using the FFT library, I decomposed the frequency of the sound into 32 parts (corresponding to 32 columns), and the amplitude into 8 parts(corresponding to 24 rows).
I'm planing to use it to hence the visual effect of the music-playing function.
